Logistic Regression Model for Predicting RV Dysfunction
This repository contains a logistic regression model designed to predict Right Ventricular (RV) Dysfunction from a dataset of patient medical records. The dataset includes various features such as heart rate, blood pressure, and echocardiography measurements, among others, to classify the severity of RV dysfunction. The model aims to aid in early diagnosis and treatment decisions for patients at risk of RV dysfunction.

Features:
Logistic Regression: Multinomial logistic regression model used to classify patients into categories: 'Normal', 'Mild', 'Moderate', 'Severe', and '0'.
Preprocessing: Handling of missing values, feature scaling, and label encoding.
Performance Metrics: Evaluation using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations include a normalized confusion matrix and precision-recall curves.
Interpretability: Clear and concise performance metrics displayed via graphs for easy interpretation.
Dataset:
The dataset consists of various medical variables such as heart rate, blood pressure, and echocardiography data, which are used to predict the severity of RV dysfunction. The data includes both continuous and categorical features.
